I have used three indicators, MACD, Aroon Oscillator and Stochastic Oscillator
I have used MACD and Stochastic in composition, that is, instead of calculating the MACD on closing prices, I have followed a similar technique on Stochastic Oscillator values.
I have added the difference between Aroon Up and Aroon Down to this indicator using some weights that I optimised.
I also changed the periods inside MACD to provide quicker responses to market changes
This strategy utilises the Aroon Indicator to identify trends, and the MACD(Stochastic) Indicator to measure momentum and trend strength, thus effectively predicting possible trend reversal
I have also implemented a Stop Loss to reduce the magnitude of losses and as a safeguard to my strategy.
This strategy seems to be working very well, giving minimum 20% annual return, while also giving 600% profit in 5 years on a random stock I chose.
I have tested on various stocks and indices, including NSE stocks, for 2 and 5 year long periods, and the strategy performs consistently.
However I am having an issue limiting the drawdowns, which sometimes rise or fall DRAMATICALLY.
The Sharpe Ratio is also consistently above 1.25, with only one exception out of all my tests.
My strategy seems to work better over longer periods of time.
