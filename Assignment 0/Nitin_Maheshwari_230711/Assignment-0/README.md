#### This is the repo for my summer project under Sujal Harkut and Vishal Himmatsinghka, ex-Finance and Analytics Club coordinators, done in the summer of 2024.
#### This project mainly revolves around quantitative finance, particularly quantitative trading.


## Week 1: Assignment 0
We were first given Assignment 0 to help us get started with slightly advanced Python and data preprocessing. 
It included having us fetch hourly data using the Yahoo Finance API and deriving the daily data from it.
It helped me refresh all of my concepts after a long semester. I chose the S&P500 as my index and Apple as my stock, as they generally have highly correlated movement.

Seeing the correlation when I plotted the daily and cumulative returns using Matplotlib was quite beautiful.
Then, I calculated the average closing price each weekday and plotted the data using a scatter plot.
I've got an idea for a trading strategy I'll try over the next few weeks: buying on lower average closing weekdays and selling
on higher average weekdays.
