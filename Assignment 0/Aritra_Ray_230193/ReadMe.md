This project was my first practical introduction to the world of quant finance! I learnt how to use the yahoofinance library, perform basic manipulations on stock data, and finally calculate the rolling mean - a technical indicator. I also learnt how to compare the performance of a single stock with that of the index it belongs to - this helps us understand if the stock performed better or worse than the market.
